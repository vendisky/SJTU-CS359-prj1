2. Part A: SimpleScalar-based Study Project

2.1 Objective:

The objective of this project is get you hand-on experiences with some techniques (mainly on cache organization and optimizations) that you have learned from textbook using a tool set called SimpleScalar
2.2 Resources for SimpleScalar

SimpleScalar is a tool set, which consists of compiler, assembler, linker, simulation, and visualization tools for the SimpleScalar architecture. With this tool set, the user can simulate real programs on a range of modern processors and systems, using fast execution-driven simulation. We provide simulators ranging from a fast functional simulator to a detailed, out-of-order issue processor that supports non-blocking caches, speculative execution, and state-of-the-art branch prediction. The tool set is partly derived from the GNU software development tools. It provides researchers with an easily extensible, portable, high-performance test bed for systems design.
The manual of the simulator can be found:  PDF manual.

2.3 Project description:

Read the problem sheet (downloadable from the problems sheet). Select three problems: two from P1-P5, and P8 is compulsory.
Work on the three problems. You need to prepare a report for the studies of the three problems in English.  
The framework for each problem study is as follows:
- Basic setting and experiment description
- Results (Figures and Tables are preferred)
- Discussion on the results you derive
- Concise conclusion
2.4 Deadline

Before class, 3 December 2013 (Tuesday)
2.5 Submission

Reports should be in the IEEE format (as explained in Section 4) and printed in paper.  
2.6 Grading

Grading will based on the following criteria
Correctness of study
Completeness of study
Quality of the report
